# Hide on bush
A chrome extension to hide hating content!

## Introduction

I really feel that many people are living to hate others, these days. Some people blindly hate others who do not fit their own values and thoughts. More and more people are saying "I'm right, you're wrong!"

I also have likes and hates. When I surf the Internet, I'm drifted to a flood of content defenselessly. Among the content, some hating content makes me frown. I think it could be one of the reasons for conflicts if it leads people to the ring where they fight.

So I made **Hide-on-bush**! to hide hating content on webs.

(comment below)
I don't think avoiding conflicts is the best way to solve the problem. However, it has become more difficult for all groups to mix and reconcile. There are more important things we have to care about. Let's be free from minor concerns!
